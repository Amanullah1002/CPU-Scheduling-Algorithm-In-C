# CPU Scheduling Algorithm In C

This repository contains various CPU Scheduling progrmas in C language as a part of our System Software Lab.
The programs that have been completed so far are : 

1. First Come First Serve(FCFS)  Non Pre-emptive
2. Shortest Job First(SJF)       Non Pre-emptive
3. Priority Scheduling           Non Pre-emptive 
4. Round Robin Scheduling        Pre-emptive
5. Bankers Algorithm
6. Simulation of Disk Scheduling Algorithm -> FCFS, SSTF, SCAN
